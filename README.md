What is AccMet Robot Navigation?
--------------------------------
AccMet is focused on developing an in-house facility  thats will utilize
a rail system with multiple robotic wagons mounted on it.

This work deals with the general problems of environment mapping, robot
path planning, motion planning, control and stability. It consists of
identifying the requirements and creating a design for a robust implementation.

For iteratively handling "Navigation" task for wagons, and the system prototyping,
the entire work has been developed in 3D simulated environment.
